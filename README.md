# DiscordBot
Back in sophomore year of high school, I wanted to take everything I had learned in my first programming class and use it in a project to solidify my knowledge of it. I didn't only manage to solidify previously learned concepts, I managed to learn a ton of different things that I wouldn't have been able to learn until after high school had I refrained from working on this project. I ended up making a Discord chat-bot and I'm leaving all the basic files here so I'll have access to them in the future.
